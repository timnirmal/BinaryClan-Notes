# WORK TO BE DONE

1. Find Characters with Yolo

Train Yolo with dataset of Sinhala Characters.
Get the bounding box of the character and assign it to the corresponding Sinhala Character.
(Need prepare dataset)

1.1 Additional Data preparation python script

Then cut character from the image

1.2 Filter out the images (If needed) with openCV

3. OCR with Keras
Get set of Data and Assign with corresponding Sinhala Characters (/Braille 
(But won't be accurate like in original method))

4. Text to Braille
   a. Text to Corresponding English letter in keyboard
   b. English to decimal numbers (or skip this step)
   c. b to Braille (six-digit number with 1/0 values)

TODO: Setup this workflow when you get a text convert into braille. No ML part involved.
